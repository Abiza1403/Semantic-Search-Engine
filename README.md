# Semantic-Search-Engine
Semantic search results are based on ontologies and machine learning.
Semantic search results are based on ontologies and machine learning. The system looks for relation between terms and finds deductive similarities. For instance, a learner searching for the query "Energy" should be given results in the physics domain and not show results about "Energy drinks", which is in fact a more popular search result.
To create a system with semantic ‘thinking’ developers use machine learning. The system looks for programmed relations and learns how to find the needed synonyms to further provide users with valid results. The most significant advantage of semantic engines is that they will always return a relevant SERP. Even if there are no entries that are a 100% match to the query, the system will still fetch the records that are related to the keyword.
Semantic analysis software can process and understand not just keywords themselves, but specific linguistic nuances. In other words, this system works pretty much like a human.
The proposed solution collects data to be used as input for search, pre- processes and normalises the collected data, creates word embeddings. Using the trained word embeddings, sentence embeddings are created for all the questions in the database. The user query is then compared to each sentence and then the results are ranked semantically using a measure based on cosine distance.
